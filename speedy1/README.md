# speedy_lang
do you think brainfuck is a complex programming language? hold my beer ... (don't believe the name, the language is not fast)

strange interpreted programming language. I haven't completed the documentation yet, but you can view 10 examples of programs. you can try to code on it, the structure of the language is very different from the standards :)

(drag the example .ssf file onto speedy1.exe to run)
